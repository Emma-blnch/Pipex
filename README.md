Recode the pipe mechanism.

> This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you already know by using it in your program.

## 📥 **What I learned**
With this project, I learned how to manage files on various modes (read, write, create, truncate). I discovered the creation of processes with fork() and the communications between processes with pipe().

I learned to have robust error handling with custom messages.

## ⚙️ **Requirements**
The functions must be written in C. It must compile with clang and the following flags :
- -Wall
- -Wextra
- -Werror

## 📁 **My files**
<ins>Pipex.c</ins> : Contains the main function. Initializes arguments, checks their validity, and triggers the operations required to execute the Pipex program.

<ins>Pipex_utils.c</ins> : Manages memory, command path finding and errors.

<ins>Create_pipe.c</ins> : Contains the logic to create the pipe used between cmd1 and cmd2.

## 📍 **Bonus**
What to do for the bonus part:
- [x] Handle multiple pipes.
- [x] Support « and » when the first parameter is "here_doc".

## ♻️ **Testing**
I strongly recommand you test each function you do *separatly* to make sure everything works fine **before** putting it together (it will help you debug).

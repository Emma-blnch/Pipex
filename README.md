# 💻 Pipex

## 🏷️ **About the project**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 6th project of the 42 cursus ➡️ *Level 2*

Recode the pipe mechanism.

## 📥 **What I learned**
With this project, I developed my:
- [ ] Polyvalence (efficient use of system commands).
- [ ] Logical thinking (analyze the steps involved in executing a command chain).

## ⚙️ **Technical skills I acquired**
- [x] Process creation and management
- [x] Robust error handling (with custom messages)
- [x] Unix system programming (using pipes to redirect flows between processes)

## 📁 **My files**
<ins>Pipex.c</ins> : Contains the main function. Checks the arguments and triggers the operations required to execute the Pipex program.

<ins>Pipex_utils.c</ins> : Init arguments and structure's variables and manages command path finding.

<ins>Handle_heredoc.c</ins> : If a here_doc is put as the first argument allows to write in the here_doc.

<ins>Create_pipe.c</ins> : Open the files, creates the pipes and execute commands.

<ins>Erros.c</ins> : Contains functions for error management and that free all variables of my struct.

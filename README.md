Recode the pipe mechanism.

## 📥 **What I learned**
With this project, I developed my:
- [ ] Polyvalence (efficient use of system commands).
- [ ] Logical thinking (analyze the steps involved in executing a command chain).

## ⚙️ **Technical skills I acquired**
- [x] Process creation and management
- [x] Robust error handling (with custom messages)
- [x] Unix system programming (using pipes to redirect flows between processes)

## 📁 **My files**
<ins>Pipex.c</ins> : Contains the main function. Initializes arguments, checks their validity, and triggers the operations required to execute the Pipex program.

<ins>Pipex_utils.c</ins> : Manages memory, command path finding and errors.

<ins>Create_pipe.c</ins> : Contains the logic to create the pipe used between cmd1 and cmd2.
